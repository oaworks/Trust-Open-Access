# Trust-Open-Access
A little add-on using various datasets to display how trusted a journal is - very prototype.

## What it can do

Using DOAJ Data, Beal data (JUST FOR FUN/TESTING) it can show notifications (see yes/no response) and content based on if a site is "trusted" or not based on this data (if it's not on those lists, it won't give a response). This is only meant to display basic functionality, and not in any way represent the actual datasets we might use.   

###Test sites

google.com (nothing)
scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=0001-3765&script=sci_serial (Ok)
